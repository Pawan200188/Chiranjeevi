# Chiranjeevi ‚Äî Brain Tumor Detection

**üìù Project Description**
--------------------------

**Chiranjeevi ‚Äî Brain Tumor Detection** is a deep learning‚Äìbased system designed to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans with high accuracy. The project leverages **state-of-the-art CNN architectures** such as **VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and YOLOv8** to identify tumors and, in some cases, localize them in real time.

The dataset, sourced from **Kaggle**, consists of **3,264 annotated MRI images**, augmented to **7,023 images** to enhance variability and generalization. Preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation were applied to prepare the data for robust training and testing.

Among all models tested, **VGG16 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 97.79%**, while **YOLOv8 demonstrated strong real-time detection and localization capabilities**, making the system both accurate and clinically practical. The project also explores lightweight architectures like **MobileNetV2** to ensure usability in **resource-constrained healthcare environments**.

For deployment, the system integrates a **Streamlit-based frontend** with a **Flask API backend**, allowing users to upload MRI scans and instantly receive diagnostic outputs such as tumor type (glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, or no tumor) and visual heatmaps for localization.

This project highlights the potential of **AI-assisted diagnostics** to:

*   Support radiologists in early detection,
    
*   Improve surgical planning through precise tumor localization,
    
*   Enhance accessibility in low-resource healthcare centers, and
    
*   Serve as an educational and research tool for advancing medical AI.

üß† Introduction to Brain Tumor Detection
----------------------------------------

Brain tumors represent one of the most complex and life-threatening neurological conditions, with their **diverse types, varying locations, and complex biological behavior**. Early and accurate detection plays a critical role in improving patient survival rates, enabling timely intervention, and reducing the risk of severe complications such as paralysis, cognitive decline, or even mortality.

Traditional diagnostic methods, such as **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** and **Computed Tomography (CT) scans**, while highly valuable, are often subject to **human interpretation and variability**. This reliance on radiologists may introduce **subjectivity, longer diagnostic times, and potential delays in treatment**.

With the rapid advancements in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Deep Learning (DL)**, particularly **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, there is immense potential to transform neuroimaging workflows. Deep learning models can automatically learn **discriminative features from MRI scans**, classify tumor types, and even localize tumor regions with high accuracy.

The **Chiranjeevi ‚Äì Brain Tumor Detection Project** integrates **state-of-the-art CNN architectures** (VGG16, ResNet, MobileNetV2, YOLOv8) with a **web-based deployment platform**. This system is designed not only to achieve high accuracy in classification but also to enable **real-time tumor detection and visualization**, making it a valuable tool in both **clinical settings** and **low-resource healthcare environments**.

Ultimately, this project demonstrates how **AI-assisted diagnostics** can complement radiologists, enhance surgical planning, and expand accessibility of advanced medical tools, driving significant improvements in patient care and medical research.
